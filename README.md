# HTML Tutorials by Mr. Siefen
 This repo contains all of Mr. Siefen' Public and FREE HTML and Web design code. Code is organized under the corresponding blog post folder. If (for example) part 3 of Website Creation code uses existing code from part 2 you will find the complete modified code including any needed stuff from part 2 in the part 3 folder. You can download just what you need from each post or grab the whole repo. While this is NOT how github should be used for ongoing projects, its great for static projects that can be downloaded in 1 .zip file or cloned all at once.
